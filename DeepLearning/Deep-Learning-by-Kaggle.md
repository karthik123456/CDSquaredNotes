### Intro to Deep Learning and Machine Vision

*Reference*: Notes on Kaggle, Deep Learning, Introduction to Deep Learning and Computer Vision   

What you should know at the end of this lesson:
1. Understand convolutions
2. Understand how models work on images 
3. Explain a convolution as a filter for images 

*Takeaways:* 

1. Convolutions are the basic building blocks for deep learning models in computer vision and other applicable area

2. Method of coverage in Kaggle is to start running models asap and come back to technical details
3. Images are stored in a computer in data containers called tensors
4. Tensors are multidimensional data containers
5. Convolutions are small tensors that can be applied to various sections of main image as a filters

7. Convolutions act as filters on tensors because it can pick out parts of the image.
