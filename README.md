What is Data Engineering?<a name="what-data-engineering"><a/>

Data Engineering is gatheriing and collecting data, stores it, processing (real-time or batch), and serves it via an API.(1). In other words, data engineering is building and maintaining various stages of a data pipeline. The final destination for data is usually a data warehouse. The data is ingested, transformed from raw form to analytical ready form, and loaded to the destination where the data will be served like an API, ERM, Datawarehouse. A datawarehouse is a central place for analytics ready data. The latter pattern to ingest raw data, transform, and load data is called ETL. There are many frameworks to do ETL. There are products for data warehousing. 

What is ETL? 
ETL stands for extract, transform, and load. The ETL Pattern is how most data pipelines are designed and structured.(1) 
1. Extract is how data is gathered from source locations
2. Transform is the process where operations are applied to raw data to get in analysis ready form
3. Load is pushing the data upstream to final destination to be used for analysis. At large companies this is often a data warehouse. 

What is Quantum Machine Learning? 
An intewrdisciplinary field at the intersection of quantum physics and machine learning. 
What example did Satya Nadella use to analogize quantum computing to classical computing performance?
Corn Maze
What is the benefit for quantum computers compared to regular computers? 
parallelism 
What is a quantum? 
smallest physical unit/entity
