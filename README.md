  Summary: The data science handbook goal is to prepare readers of various skill levels to be compotent data scientist, complete a data project, or become what the book calls a "Data unicorns". The book is broken down into three sections: 
            1. The stuff you'll always use part equip a reader with skills to solve simple data problems and covers subjects likely to arise in any data project
            2. Stuff you still need to know cover a range of topics which a professional data scienctist will likely use during their career. 
            3. Specialized or advanced topics covers topics in greater depth from part 1 and 2, and moves from nuts and bolts applications to more abstract theory
